- 👋 Hi, I’m @CamelliaTenebris
- 👀 I’m interested in art, UX design and games. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UI/UX Design and Graphic Design. For coding, currently invested in HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. Currently full-time student, more design than code so...maybe when I reach that coding level some time later?
- 📫 How to reach me? Through email camellia.tenebris@gmail.com and Twitter @camellia_tnb.
